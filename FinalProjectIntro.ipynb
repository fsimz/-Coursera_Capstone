    "<b>Introduction/Business Problem:</b>\n",
    "Train a predictive model to determine a suitable location for opening a new cafe/coffee shop business.<p>\n",
    "    <b>Hypothesis:</b> The hypothesis is that the venues in areas with a high density of cafe/coffee shops can be used to predict a suitable location for a a similar business in a  different area.<br>\n",
    "    Can training data from one location be used to predict optimal cafe locations in a different area?\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    <b>Data/Methodology:</b>\n",
    "       1. Scrape wikipedia table to collect UK postcodes and town data.\n",
    "       2. Clean the html data into a suitable dataframe.\n",
    "       3. Obtain coordinates for scraped postcodes from Geocoder library. Ignore postcodes which dont return coordinates.\n",
    "          - Only keep data for London and Midlands. The London data will be used to train a model to predict new locations in the midlands.\n",
    "       4. Use FourSquare API to return nearby venues for each coordinate and build dataframe.\n",
    "       5. Calculate frequency of venues for each postcode and build dataframe.\n",
    "       6. Training data: Filter data to only include London data AND postcodes in which Cafe/Coffee shop feature in\n",
    "          top 5 most frequent AND postcodes which include at least 5 other surrounding venues:\n",
    "          - Calculate number of venues for each postcode.\n",
    "          - Get combined frequency for Cafe and Coffee Shop.\n",
    "          - Get normalised frequency by dividing by number of venues.\n",
    "          - For regression, use venue frequency values as X features and normalised frequency as Y.\n",
    "       7. Use training data to test machine learning regression models:\n",
    "          - Split data for train and test.<br>\n",
    "          - Regression machine learning: Random Forest Regression, Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression.<br>\n",
    "          - Tune hyperparameters and Evaluate best performing model (Measure RMSE).\n",
    "       8. Use nearby venue data from a different city as features to predict suitable locations for a Cafe/Coffee shop.<br>\n",
    "          - Use Regression model to predict Cafe frequencies for new post codes.\n",
    "          - Cluster data based and visualize best and worse areas to open a Cafe business.\n",
